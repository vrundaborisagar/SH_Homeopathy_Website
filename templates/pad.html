  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a circulatory condition where narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the limbs, usually the legs. It commonly results from atherosclerosis — a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries — which restricts blood circulation. PAD can lead to leg pain during walking, poor wound healing, and in severe cases, tissue damage or ulcers. Early detection and natural care are key to managing symptoms and preventing progression.

     This patient had been suffering from PAD for over 5 years and could barely walk 500 meters without severe leg pain. After visiting several doctors without relief, he turned to Dr. Borisagar's SH Homeopathy. With just 3-4 months of our personalized kit, he regained his strength and can now comfortably walk 3-4 kilometers without pain. His life has dramatically improved — all without surgery or harsh medications.
