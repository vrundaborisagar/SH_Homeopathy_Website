  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from the lower back through the hips and buttocks and down each leg. It typically affects only one side of the body. The condition is commonly caused by herniated discs, bone spurs, or spinal narrowing compressing part of the nerve. Sciatica can cause intense discomfort, weakness, or numbness along the nerve path.

      He had been suffering from severe leg and back pain due to Sciatica for over 5 years. Despite taking treatment for 2 years in Jamnagar and consulting more than four different doctors, every one of them recommended surgery as the only option. But he chose a natural path with SH Homeopathy. After just 4 months of our specialized Sciatica kit, his pain completely vanished. Today, he can stand and work all day without discomfort — surgery was never needed. His recovery is a powerful reminder of how homeopathy can offer true relief, even in the most chronic cases.
