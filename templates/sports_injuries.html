  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Sports injuries are common among athletes and active individuals and can affect muscles, ligaments, joints, and bones. These injuries often result from overuse, improper training techniques, inadequate warm-up, or direct impact during physical activity. They can range from mild sprains to severe fractures and often lead to pain, swelling, and limited mobility. Quick and effective treatment is essential to ensure proper healing and return to activity.
