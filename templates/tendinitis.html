  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Tendinitis is the inflammation or irritation of a tendon — the thick fibrous cords that attach muscle to bone. It causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint, most commonly in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, or heels. Overuse, injury, or aging can all lead to this condition. Left untreated, it may result in tendon rupture or chronic joint pain, significantly affecting mobility and daily life.
