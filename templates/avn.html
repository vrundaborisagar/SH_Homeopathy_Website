    Avascular Necrosis (AVN) is a condition where the blood supply to a bone is disrupted or reduced, leading to the gradual death of bone tissue. Without enough blood, the bone weakens, can collapse, and often causes serious pain and stiffness, especially in joints like the hip.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Stages of AVN:</h2>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Stage I</strong><br>
    • Bone appears mostly normal on X-rays, but blood supply is reduced.<br>
    • Mild pain or stiffness may be present. Early treatment can slow progression.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Stage II</strong><br>
    • Small cracks appear as blood supply worsens.<br>
    • Femoral head becomes rougher. Pain and stiffness increase.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Stage III</strong><br>
    • Collapse or flattening of the femoral head begins.<br>
    • Movement becomes difficult, pain worsens, visible collapse on X-ray.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Stage IV</strong><br>
    • Severe joint damage and arthritis develop.<br>
    • Constant pain, surgery may be needed for relief.</p>

    He was diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis (AVN), and every doctor he visited told him the same thing — that he would need joint replacement surgery. One doctor said he would have to walk with a walker for at least two years. Another warned that if he didn’t undergo surgery, he would need to get holes drilled in his back to relieve the pressure. Faced with fear and uncertainty, he chose SH Homeopathy instead. With our AVN treatment kit, he experienced natural recovery — without surgery, without a walker, and without invasive procedures. His progress is a true example of how safe, gentle care can restore hope and mobility.
