  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Cervical spondylosis is a degenerative condition that affects the bones, discs, and joints of the neck (cervical spine). It is commonly caused by age-related wear and tear that results in thinning of the spinal discs and development of bone spurs. This can lead to stiffness, pain, and restricted neck movement. Cervical spondylosis is very common after middle age, and its severity varies from mild discomfort to serious nerve compression.
