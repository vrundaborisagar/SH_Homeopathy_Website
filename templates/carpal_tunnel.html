      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a painful condition caused by pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the narrow carpal tunnel in the wrist. It often leads to numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers, especially at night or after repetitive movements. Early care and proper management can help reduce symptoms and prevent long-term damage.

      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a common condition that develops when the median nerve, which runs through a small passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, becomes compressed or irritated. This can cause pain, tingling, and numbness in the fingers and hand, making everyday tasks like typing, gripping, or lifting difficult. Early attention and gentle, supportive treatments can help ease discomfort and prevent the condition from getting worse.
