  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Varicose veins are enlarged, swollen, and twisted veins that typically appear on the legs. They are often blue or dark purple and may bulge from under the skin. Caused by faulty valves in the veins that allow blood to pool, varicose veins can lead to aching, heaviness, and discomfort — especially after long hours of standing or sitting. While common, untreated cases may result in complications such as ulcers, clots, or skin changes.

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Vein diseases progress through five stages — from spider veins to venous ulcers. Each stage represents worsening vein health, with increasing discomfort, swelling, and risk of complications. Early signs include minor cosmetic changes, but without timely care, the condition may escalate to painful ulcers. Dr. Borisagar’s SH Homeopathy Kit supports recovery at each stage, targeting root causes, easing symptoms, and helping patients avoid surgery through natural healing and vein strengthening remedies.

     She was suffering from severe varicose veins, accompanied by swelling, pain, and visible discomfort. After consulting a doctor in Rajkot, she was advised to undergo surgery. Before proceeding with the operation, she chose to try SH Homeopathy. Remarkably, after using just 50% of the treatment kit, she experienced significant relief. The pain reduced, the swelling diminished, and the veins became far less prominent — all without surgical intervention. She is truly grateful for the effective and natural healing offered by SH Homeopathy.
