        <strong>O.A. Knee with Gout</strong> is a painful condition where long-term wear and tear of the knee joint is combined with sudden attacks of uric acid crystals. The damaged cartilage from osteoarthritis and excess uric acid cause inflammation, swelling, and stiffness. This leads to difficulty in moving the knee and increased pain, especially during flare-ups.
